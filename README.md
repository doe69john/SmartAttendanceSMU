# SmartAttendance Platform

SmartAttendance is a two-part attendance solution: a React web app that students and staff use in their browsers, and a Spring Boot service that handles authentication, face-recognition workflows, and reporting APIs. The web client only talks to the backend over HTTPS, so each tier can be hosted independently.

Head into `backend/` or `frontend/` for developer setup guides and environment details.
